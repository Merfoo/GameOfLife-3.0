Game of Life 3.0
----------------

This is a version of the classic Game of Life, except
with a few changes.  Instead of two states, each cell
has 60.  This game was made by a team of 9 programmers
and artists in a 24 hour programming tournament held 
by Urban Airship in Portland, Oregon.  We are now continuing to make this awesomer!
